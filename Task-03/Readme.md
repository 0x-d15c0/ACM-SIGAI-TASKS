# Transfer Learning with YOLOv3-tiny for Object Detection

### Introduction
In this project, I demonstrate transfer learning using the YOLOv3-tiny model for object detection. It uses a random object detection dataset to evaluate the model's performance and metrics. YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system that applies a single neural network to the full image. YOLOv3-tiny is a smaller, faster version of YOLOv3, making it suitable for real-time applications on limited hardware.

### Dataset
Random object detection dataset from Kaggle.
